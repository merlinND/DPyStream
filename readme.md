## How to run this app

You will need to have python *3.0* (or higher) installed to execute our application. See [python's site](http://www.python.org/) for help with that.

1. Install python (say, at `path/to/python`)
2. Change your directory to the root folder: `cd path/to/DPyStream/`
3. Add the resources you want (and change the catalog accordingly)
4. Execute the main file: `path/to/python DPyStream.py`
5. The server is now running.
6. To shutdown the server, at any time, just press `Enter`

### Note

At the INSA, you will find python already installed at this path: `"C:\Program Files\LibreOffice 4.0\program\python.exe"`
Also, the resources are already loaded according to the present catalog.
